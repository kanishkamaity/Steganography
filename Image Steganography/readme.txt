I have executed the code in Google colab.
The code provided can be opened with a Jupyter notebook. 

If the user wants to hide a text message inside a cover image by running the code, then the cover image must be present in the same folder and the name of the image along with extension is to be provided as input. Next the secret key is given as input. Then the secret message to be hidden is provided. Finally the name of the image is to be provided which will be used to indicate the steganographed image.
The steganographed image and the retrieved message will be displayed.
